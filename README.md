# NYU_Libreserve
This script serves to automatically reserve a study room at NYU by urllib and urllib2.
Some of the features are as following:
* Automatically login into the user's account.
* Manually fill in the reservation date or automatically fill in the day after tomorrow of the latest reservation date.
* The default "Select length" is 2 hours.
* There is a list indicating the pripority of several options of room numbers.


NOTE: 
Since the study room reservation page has been upgraded on April, this script is currently not functional for the new page.
